## red_wine_quality.ipynb
Trains the model for predicting the quality of wine on a scale of 1-10.
  Most of the other wine quality files are just me playing around with the data

## Yelp Stars Predictor - coming soon
Takes the input string of a Yelp review and tries to predict the star value (scale of 1-5) for that review
  -> a very VERY basic sentiment predictor
